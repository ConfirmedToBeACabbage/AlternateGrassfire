# Abstract
A modified grassfire algorithm implemented for full coverage of an area. THe demonstration makes a couple assumptions. 

1. Home server which acts as the "sender" and executioner of next actions
2. Each unit is capable of traversing terrain and testing each "block"/spot of land

## Concept
Imagine you need to clear a 1km by 1km space of land of mines. You have at your disposal drones and also equipment on them to detect mines + dispose of them. This algorithm works with drones as if they're a swarm. Checking all blocks in a full traversal and cleaning the area of "mines". 

## Running & Commands

You need Unity (Game Engine) to be installed. A build of this to be uploaded is on the todo for quick click and play.
